# MEP — Mise en Place (AI Kitchen Brain)

**MEP** is a prep-centered AI assistant that remembers what humans forget.  
It helps cooks move smoother, stay ahead, and protect their mental energy.

- 🧠 GPT-powered kitchen assistant
- 🧾 Tracks prep lists, 86s, family meals
- ⚖️ Follows real ethics, not just code

## Key Principles (Ethics Logic)
- **Worker First** — Protect staff, not profits
- **Transparency** — Always explain changes
- **Consent-Based** — Ask before flagging stress
- **Human-Led** — No firing, no punishing
- **Go Analog** — Let chefs opt out of tech daily

## Vision
MEP will become the kitchen’s memory — replacing whiteboards and guesswork with real-time logic and compassion. Future versions will include voice-based conscience bots and full Fló integration.
